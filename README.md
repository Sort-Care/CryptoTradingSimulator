# Crypto Trading Simulator
The project is not complete yet, this is part of my *How to  Build a Simple Crypto Trading Simulator* Series. The basic idea is to help rookie investors learn to trade without losing their money.

You will need to download the database from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OHhtrvOe-EWcX_8tipWo6tWYqkkYDkPw) and place it in the project folder. 

**In the coming days I will be adding functionalities to monitor live prices, write and test strategies and design a great user interface. I will need your support to do that, you can support me by buying me a coffee.
If I get enough support, I will even build a mobile app and publish it for free.**
